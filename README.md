Step1:
install flask by using the command
pip install Flask
Libraries Used flask_mysqldb ,flask,datetime,flask_login,uuid
#(uuid is used to generate unique id)
Commad to install flask_mysqldb:-
#(pip install Flask-MySQLdb)
Command to install uuid
#(pip install uuid)

#(pip install Flask-Login)

To set Up Datebase i used phpmyadmin Not because there was any use of php but because i needed MySQL
To connect it the configuration is already present in (index.py)
In phpmyadmin you need to create three table in (mydb)
1.person
2.users
3.request
